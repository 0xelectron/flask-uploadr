# soundcloud-uploadr

soundcloud-uploadr is forked from <a href="https://github.com/kirsle/flask-multi-upload">flask-multi-upload</a>. Thanks <a href="https://github.com/kirsle">kirle</a>!.

soundcloud-uploadr is an simple flask app to upload songs to SoundCloud using SoundCloud's Python API and Export Songs Details to csv.It demonstrates that you can combine a multi-file upload form along with other form data (i.e. letting a user choose playlist to upload the songs into). There's also a live progress bar that tells you the current progress of the upload. It doesn't break it down by individual file though, to keep things simpler.

It's backwards compatible and also works with clients that have scripts disabled.

It works in most modern browsers and Internet Explorer 10+.
